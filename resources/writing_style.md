This page is to serve as a checklist for my advisees when editing manuscripts.
Before we get into the specific suggestions below you should probably read a 
few books and articles on the topic. 

You should probably read 
[Strunk & White "The Elements of Style""](https://www.bartleby.com/141/).
This short book provides basic grammatical comments that are extremely important. 
Even just reading the table of contents is a quick reminder. 

You should also read about 
[Scientific Writing](https://canvas.hull.ac.uk/courses/370/pages/scientific-writing-style)
and how it differs from other writing styles.
In particular, we are more interested in precise language and statements than 
in 

Since you are getting a degree in Statistics, you should read the 
[American Mathematical Society (AMS) Style Guide](https://www.ams.org/publications/authors/AMS-StyleGuide-online.pdf) 
(which is pretty lengthy)
and the 
[American Statistical Association Sttyle Guide](https://www.ams.org/publications/authors/AMS-StyleGuide-online.pdf)
(which should be thought of as building upon the AMS guide).


## Capitalization

The following should be capitalized when referring to specific instances:

- Section 2
- Table 3
- Figure 4
- Equation (3)

## Mathematics

Sentences should not start with mathematical symbols.
