## Course overview

I think of this course as a regression course for non-statistics graduate 
students. 
Despite the prerequisites, it is common that students in this course have 
little background in probability and statistics. 

A core component of this course 
(and perhaps different from other STAT 587 sections) is understanding Bayesian 
and frequentist approaches to inference so that these students understand the 
difference and can interpret Bayesian analyses in their literature. 
To understand these approaches to inference a background in the basics of 
probability theory is taught. 

### Modules

The course is broken down into 3 modules: probability, inference, and 
regression. The probability module introduces the basics of discrete and 
continuous random variables including the binomial and normal distributions. 
The inference module uses these two distributions to introduce the basics 
of Bayesian and frequentist approaches. 
The regression module then uses these inferential approaches within the context
of simple and multiple linear regression. 
The perspective throughout is on designed experiments rather than observational
studies.
