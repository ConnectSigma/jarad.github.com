### [Next courses](http://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/)

A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a Masters Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-master%E2%80%99s-students) requires 587, 
588, and at least one other 3-credit 400-level or above STAT course. 
A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a PhD Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-phd-students) requires 587, 588, and at least 2 other 3-credit 400-level or above STAT courses.
A maximum of nine 400-level courses can be included on a graduate program of study (POS). 

Statistics courses are listed on 
[the University Course Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/), 
but I have pulled out those courses that are likely to be of interest to 
graduates of STAT 587.

- STAT 588 - Statistical Theory for Research Workers
  - STAT 474/574 - Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis
  - STAT 478/578 - Introduction to Stochastic Process Models
  - STAT 476/576 - Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis
- STAT 471/571 - Introduction to Experimental Design 
- STAT 472/572 - Introduction to Time Series
- STAT 473/573 - Introduction to Survey Sampling
- STAT 475/575 - Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis (matrix algebra)
- STAT 477/577 - Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis
- STAT 484/584 - Computer Processing of Scientific Data
- STAT 581 - Analysis of Gene Expression Data for the Biological Sciences

You should look for courses that say "May not be used for graduate credit in the Statistics MS and PhD degree programs" as these courses are meant for non-statistics graduate students.
