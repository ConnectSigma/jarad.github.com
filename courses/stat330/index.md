This website is designed to host course material for STAT 330 - Probability and Statistics for Computer Science at 
[Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu).
These materials will be available even after the course is over, 
although they may be updated.

## Textbook

The optional textbook for this course is 
Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists by Michael Baron (3rd ed). 

![](baron_3rd.jpeg "Probability and Statistics for Computer Scientists by Michael Baron (3rd ed)")

The main improvement in the 3rd edition is the inclusion of R code in addition
to the MATLAB code. 
Since I use R for any code that I write, 
this is an appreciated inclusion. 


Here are some free resources that can be used:

- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics)
- [Online Statistics Education](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/)
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Software 

No software is required for this course, 
but the instructor will use the Statistical Software [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
when demonstrating concepts in class. 
The instructor will be using RStudio as the interface to [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Videos

For Basic Probability, I have a 
[1 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBP7KBtM9vI) 
containing all the probability required for the course. 
Alternatively, I have a 
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHD4aOUZFp0a_m9HXdVu3_ZnfphUY0oJ) 
that has the basic probability topics separated into individual videos.

For random varibles, I have an 
[introductory video](https://youtu.be/ajLFqrPTAcY) 
that describes the different between discrete and continuous random variables. 
Then, I have a video about 
[general discrete random variables](https://youtu.be/FrL4Dcoy9MI)
and videos about 

- [Bernoulli](https://youtu.be/NXUkzZhrrcA),
- [binomial](https://youtu.be/cnJjKX5AHi4), and
- [Poisson](https://youtu.be/NTWD-EyTkR0)

random variables and their distributions as well as a video about 
[multiple discrete random variables](https://youtu.be/1U537aiXJzM).

Moving on to continuous random variables, I have a video about
[general continuous random variables](https://youtu.be/KbfUnaiarps)
and videos specfically about 

- [uniform](https://youtu.be/S_tw8UZqJ6U),
- [exponential](https://youtu.be/e5vCX4uCGvY),
- [gamma](https://youtu.be/YkF3D8OHZwc), and
- [normal (or Gaussian)](https://youtu.be/c22x0xpvkyY)

random variables and their distributions.

The normal distribution is extremely important due to the result of the 
Central Limit Theorem (CLT) introduced in 
[this video](https://youtu.be/xSNg9Vp1wko) 
and made a bit more practical in 
[this follow up video](https://youtu.be/xSNg9Vp1wko).
There is a 3rd video in this CLT series, but I don't think it is too helpful
(in retrospect). 

At the moment, I don't have videos on Markov chains, Poisson processes, and
queuing systems. 

The videos I have on statistical inference a much more in depth than we have 
time for in STAT 330. 
If you are interested in this depth, then you can following along with 
[this playlist]9https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHD4aOUZFp1PZC6SgtuS-ESq4ti1GEFj).

## Course Description

Topics from probability and statistics applicable to computer science. 
Basic probability; Random variables and their distributions; 
Stochastic processes including Markov chains; Queuing models; 
Basic statistical inference; Introduction to regression.



## Prerequisite

This course requires MATH 166 (Calculus II). 
Integrals are needed to compute expectations of continuous random variables and
derivatives are needed to obtain maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs).
