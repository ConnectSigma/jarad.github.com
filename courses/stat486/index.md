Introduction to Statistical Computing at 
[Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu).


## Relevant course pages

- [Slides](slides)


## Textbook

The required textbook for this course is 

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

### Additional free textbooks

- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)
- [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)

## Software 

We will be using the Statistical Software [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
I will be using RStudio as the interface to [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
Although both will be available on lab computers, I suggest you install 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) 
on your own laptop or desktop (or both).
