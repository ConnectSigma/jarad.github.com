Machine learning is a branch of computer science focused on prediction


There are a lot of synonyms between 
[statistics and machine learning](http://www.john-ros.com/translator/).
Here is a subset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
synonyms <- tribble(
  ~statistics, ~`machine learning`,
  "variable","feature",
  "response variable", "target",
  "clustering","unsupervised learning",
  "classification","supervised learning",
  "dummy variables","one-hot encoding",
  "estimation","learning",
  "transformation","feature creation"
) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```
